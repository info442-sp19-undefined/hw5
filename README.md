- **User testing** - Using thinking aloud protocol, see if users does the intended action, and are able to navigate smoothly through our interface. 
- **Functionality testing** - Have users test our interface. Record any bugs and the steps to reproduce that bug. Talk to the person responsible for the code and share findings. 
- **Code Review** - double check the code before merging to the master branch.
- **Peer Review** code and leave comments to verify the code 
- **Progress timeline** - using Trello
- Aggregate tasks and make it easier to differentiate which tasks are done and needs to be done.

## Practices will be following to improve the process if it's not working
- If it is not working, pin it where it is not working, screenshot it, and let the team know.
- Debug using the IDE
- Create Github Issues when something is wrong.
