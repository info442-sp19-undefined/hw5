# Specify the Process
## Communication
- For any *project related questions*, we will communicate via our **Slack channel**. The reason that we will use **Slack** to communicate project questions, specifically code questions, is that sending code on Slack retains the structure of the code and syntax highlighting. This makes it easier and more efficient to read code. Moreover, slack contains an app where it can directly connect to our repository and notify everyone who has committed to the repository. With this in mind, it will help avoid merge conflicts. Additionally, we are able to set goals and create checklists for the project using Slackâ€™s extension application kyber for our project. 
- For any *personal or social conversations*, we will communicate via our **Messenger** group chat. This is the platform in which every teammate uses regularly and replies the fastest. Additionally, there is a video call, phone call, voice recording function in this app so we may communicate in more ways than just via text messaging. 

- *Reminders of assignments* and goals will be sent through the **Messenger** group chat.

## Release Candidate Date
We will have a release candidate by week 10 - June 5th.

## Practices will be using to know if we're making progress toward that release candidate
- **User testing** - Using thinking aloud protocol, see if users does the intended action, and are able to navigate smoothly through our interface. 

- **Functionality testing** - Have users test our interface. Record any bugs and the steps to reproduce that bug. Talk to the person responsible for the code and share findings. 

- **Code Review** - double check the code before merging to the master branch.
Peer Review code and leave comments to verify the code 

- **Progress timeline** - using Trello
- Aggregate tasks and make it easier to differentiate which tasks are done and needs to be done.

## Practices will be following to improve the process if it's not working
- If it is not working, pin it where it is not working, screenshot it, and let the team know.
- Debug using the IDE
- Create Github Issues when something is wrong.
- Hold each other accountable for the code we are responsible for.

## Non-code related practices: 
- Document weekly goals for each team member and check in frequently on the progress of these goals.
- Meet together in real life to work on the project together, instead of working remotely.
Update documentations on new behaviors of each component as well as what changed.
- Use Trello to make sure we are keeping up-to-date with progress.
- Daily stand-up meeting in the morning on slack, to talk about our goals for the day related to our project and what we are looking forward to that day. 
- Dinner after lecture on Thursdays to get to know each other a bit more and discuss project plans
- Rotating bringing food and snacks to team meetings.
